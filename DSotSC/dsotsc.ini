# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = This was originally a partial conversion for BG1 - Tales of the Sword Coast. It now uses the WeiDU format, and is compatible with BGT and EET. New spells, items, 5 major quests, new areas, and 6 (silent) NPCs are available to your party. Quests include rescuing a child from vampires, saving a town from a dragon, and searching for missing people.
The mod starts after you complete the Cloakwood Mines. Return to the Friendly Arms Inn to meet with Jet'laya. As in the original DSotSC mod, other areas are also modified, so some parts to this mod you may see before Chapter 5.
